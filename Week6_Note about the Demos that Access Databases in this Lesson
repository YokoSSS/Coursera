Oracle Database is NOT PROVIDED: The examples shown in the videos about accessing a database reference an Oracle database. 
They are examples only -- the course DOES NOT provide access to an Oracle database. 
If you run the code shown in the videos to connect an Oracle database, you will receive an error because the database does not exist.

In addition, SAS/ACCESS Engine to PC Files must be licensed to access database files. 
SAS OnDemand for Academics does not include the software necessary to read database files such as Microsoft Access files. 

You can learn about accessing database files by watching these videos. If you have access to your own SAS software and 
have a license for SAS/ACCESS Engine to PC Files,  you can practice in your own environment.
