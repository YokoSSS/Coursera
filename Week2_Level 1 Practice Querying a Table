Level 1 Practice: Querying a Table

1.If necessary, start SAS Studio before you begin. If you restarted your SAS session, submit your libname.sas program to access the practice data.

The sq.transactionfull table contains customer and transaction information.  Using the sq.transactionfull table, 
write a PROC SQL step to generate a report for large transactions that are not related to tuition payments to universities. 

Use the following requirements as you generate the report:

Display the following columns in this order: CustomerName, MerchantName, Type, Service, and Amount from the sq.transactionfull table.

Select rows that have a transaction Amount value greater than $1,000 and a Service value not equal to University.

Order the rows such that the largest transaction is listed first.

Format the Amount column with the DOLLAR10.2 format.

Label CustomerName as Customer Name, and Amount as Transaction Amount.

Add the title Large Non-Educational Transactions.

Run the program and view the results.

What is the first value for Transaction Amount?  

Answer:
The first value is $4,072.08.
Solution code:

/*s102s01.sas*/

title 'Large Non-Educational Transactions';
proc sql;
select CustomerName label='Customer Name', 
       MerchantName, Type, Service, 
       Amount format=dollar10.2 label='Transaction Amount'
    from sq.transactionfull
    where Amount >1000 and 
          Service ne 'University'
    order by Amount desc;
quit;
