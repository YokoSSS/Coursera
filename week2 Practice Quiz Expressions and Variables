1.In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. 
The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, 
the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.

1 bill = 47.28
2 tip = bill * 0.15
3 total = bill + tip
4 share =  round(total / 2,2)
5 print(f"Each person needs to pay: {share}")
