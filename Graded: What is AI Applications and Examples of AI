Which of the following is NOT a good way to define AI?

0 / 1点

AI is Augmented Intelligence and is not intended to replace human intelligence rather extend human capabilities 
Uncorrect

AI is all about machines replacing human intelligence.


AI is the use of algorithms that enable computers to find patterns without humans having to hard code them manually


AI is the application of computing to solve problems in an intelligent way using algorithms.

不正解
AI is all about using algorithms on structured or unstructured data, in order to find patterns that we may not have even known exist, 
without us having to hard code these patterns into computers, to solve problems in an intelligent way. AI is not about replacing 
human intelligence, rather augmenting it and accomplishing tasks that neither humans nor machines could do on their own.
