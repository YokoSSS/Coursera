Add an ARRAY statement to create a two-dimensional array.

Name the array PMT.

The row dimension should reference the values 2015, 2016, and 2017.

The column dimension should reference the values 1 to 2.

The array elements should be temporary.

Use the following as the six initial values:

Run the program and view the results.
