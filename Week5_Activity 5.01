ERROR: Column 2 from the first contributor of INTERSECT is not the same type as its counterpart from the second.

By default, the INTERSECT set operator matches by column position, and the data must be of the same type. 
EmailResp is character, and SalesRep is numeric.  




2.Add the CORR keyword after the INTERSECT set operator. 

Run the query.
