When the word scanner sees a quotation mark, it holds all subsequent text in an attempt to build a literal token. 
The literal token ends when the word scanner sees a matching quotation mark. If the user forgot to end the literal with 
a matching quotation mark, the next quotation mark might be the start of another literal token, further down in the code. 
In this case, the resulting literal token might contain SAS statements, and this will likely result in a syntax error when compiled.
