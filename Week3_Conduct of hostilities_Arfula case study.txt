Welcome back to the Arfula case study. Previously, we saw that the tensions in Arfula had evolved into an armed conflict. In this video, we will provide the facts so that you later on will be able to apply some of the corals on the conduct of hostilities to the situation in Arfula. Turning to the facts. The fighting has continued for over a year on Arfulian territory between the AMF and the FAR. In response to the FAR's military gains the AMF starts to invest in new weapons technologies, such as armed drones, in order to destroy the enemy and win the war. Arm drones begin to frequently fly over the eastern Digaji and southern Faneo districts where the FAR controls the majority of the territory and conducts military operations. As a result, a drone strike hits the prominent foreign military barracks in the eastern Digaji district and kills a well-known military commander, Eqola. Civilians are unfortunately also hit by the strike. The Bogona family for instance, consisting of Jan, his wife, their daughter and son, as well as Jan's mother, live in a small wooden house located only 50 meters away from the military barracks. The drone attack destroys part of their house, the grand mother and daughter end up in a hospital in critical condition. The use of armed drones and the resulting civilian damage infuriates some of the inhabitants of the eastern Digaji district. Jan and his son even prepare their own Molotov cocktails, which they use shortly thereafter, against the AMF.
