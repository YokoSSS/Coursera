Activity 2.06

1.Open m102a05.sas from the activities folder and perform the following tasks:

Modify the TITLE statement reference to &type by adding a period before the 's'.

Replace the hardcoded text sashelp in the FOOTNOTE and PROC statements with a reference to the Lib macro variable (&lib).

Run the program and examine the log and the error statements. 

What is the name of the table that SAS attempts to read?

SASHELP.CARS
uncorect

WORK.SASHELPCARS
corect
The period is not included between SASHELP and CARS because the period after &lib is treated as a macro variable delimiter rather than text. 

&lib.CARS
