Activity 2.08

1.Open m102a07.sas from the activities folder and perform the following tasks:

Review the program and notice that the DATA step creates a table named Avg_MPG. 

Highlight the DATA step and the %PUT statement, and run the selected code. 

Review the log to see all automatic macro variables stored in the global symbol table.

Which macro variables store the date and the last table created?

Note: All questions in this practice are free response and all answers are marked correct. 
Type your responses and compare them to the answers provided.


My answer:
footnote "Created on <date>";

SYSDATE9 stores the date that the SAS session started and SYSLAST stores the name of the last SAS table created.  
SYSDATE9にはSASセッションの開始日、SYSLASTには最後に作成されたSASテーブルの名称が格納されます。 


2.Use macro variable references in the TITLE2 and FOOTNOTE statements to insert the table name and date into the program.


Run the program. 

Is the table name is included in the second title and the date included in the footnote?
