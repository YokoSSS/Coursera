Create the Case Study Input Tables

In this case study, you use the following input tables:

sq.claimsraw 

sq.enplanement2017 

sq.boarding2013_2016 

Follow these steps to create the input tables:

If necessary, sign in to SAS OnDemand for Academics and run libname.sas to redefine the SQ library. 

Open the caseStudy folder and run the casestudy_createdata.sas program. 

The PDF linked below shows the data layout for each input table in the case study. The layout lists the column name, a description, 
and any value requirements for that column. You will refer to this document as you prepare the data.

The input tables were created for this case study from the following:

TSA Airport Claims data from https://www.dhs.gov/tsa-claims-data
https://www.dhs.gov/tsa-claims-data

FAA Airport Facilities data from https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/
https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/

FAA Enplanements data from https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/
https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/

Here are a few notes regarding the data: 

All data is public data, and accuracy is not guaranteed.

The claimsraw table was created by concatenating each individual TSA Airport Claims table. 

The concatenated results of the TSA Airport Claims tables were joined with the FAA Airport Facilities data. The column Airport_Codes from the TSA Airport Claims data was joined with Location_ID from the FAA Airports Facilities data to obtain airport information. Some Airport_Codes values do not correspond to Location_ID values.

Columns in the TSA Airport Claims data have changed over the years. Because of this, some of the original columns were removed from the data for this case study.

Some column names and data types have been changed in the FAA Enplanement data for this case study.
