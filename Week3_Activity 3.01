Activity 3.01


1.Open m103a01.sas from the activities folder and perform the following tasks:

Examine the TITLE statement. Run the program and view the results.


%let text=class list;
title "upcase(&text)";
proc print data=sashelp.class;
run;
title;


Add % before the UPCASE function in the TITLE statement. Run the program. 

%let text=class list;
title "%upcase(&text)";
proc print data=sashelp.class;
run;
title;


What text appears as the title?

Note: Type the title exactly as it appears.

My Answer: CLASS LIST

正解
The title is CLASS LIST. The macro %UPCASE function converts the value of the Text macro 
variable to uppercase before the TITLE statement executes. 

%let text=class list;
title "%upcase(&text)";
proc print data=sashelp.class;
run;
