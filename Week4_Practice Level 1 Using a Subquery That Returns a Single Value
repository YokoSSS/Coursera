The sq.statepopulation table contains estimated population statistics for every state in the US and its territories. 
You want to determine which states have an estimated three-year population growth greater than the average for all states.

Using the sq.statepopulation table, write a query that displays the average three-year population growth for all states. 

Use the nPopChg3 column to calculate the average from the sq.statepopulation table. 

Run the program and view the results.

Use the query you just wrote to display the states that have a projected three-year population growth greater than the 
overall average. Use the following requirements:

Include Name and nPopChg3 in the results.

Label nPopChg3 as Estimated Growth and format the values with commas.

Use the query from step 1 to subset the table.

Order the results by descending nPopChg3.

Add an appropriate title.

Run the query and view the results.

Which state has the greatest estimated growth in your results?
