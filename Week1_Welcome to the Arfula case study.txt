Welcome to the Arfula case study. Here, you will be able to test your International Humanitarian Law or IHL knowledge, by applying it to conflict situations in the fictitious country of Arfula. In this video, we will introduce you to the case study, in order to provide you with the information that you will need, to complete a few short assignments later on. Let's begin by having a look into the demographics of Arfula. The capital of Arfula is Xyrat. The country is made up of four districts: Cushane, Degaji, Fauneo and Eske. Cushane, where the capital Xyrat is located, is Arfula's most populated district. Politically speaking, Arfula is a Presidential Socialist Republic run by a single party, the Arfula Communist Party. State power within Arfula, is exercised through the Arfula Communist Party. The Secretary General of the leading party, who is therefore also the President of Arfula, is Pong. There are no substantial political opposition groups. The Arfula Communist Party wins the elections by default. The lives of the Arfulians are controlled and monitored by the Arfula Communist Party. The economic system of Arfula is based on public ownership, and controlled by the government. There are two main economic sectors: The agriculture sector, which produces rice, beans, cotton, peanuts, crops and fruits, and the industrial sector, which produces cement, building and construction material, as well as rubber and plastic products. Arfula has to cope with several challenges. The climate is changing and temperatures rise, leading to crop failure. The agriculture sector therefore fails to sustain the economy. The planned economic system of communism, also results in a larger gap between those in charge, and the rest of the population. Tyranny, economic decline of poverty, lead to a sense of insecurity among Arfulians.
