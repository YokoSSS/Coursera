In this video, we'll introduce you to the structure and the goals of this course.

English for STEM has five units. Unit 1 asks the question, is the Earth getting warmer?

Unit 2 is on the greenhouse effect. Unit 3 deals with the impacts of climate change on our world.

Unit 4 is about discovering cleaner energy sources to power the world.

And unit 5 asks, what might the future hold?

Throughout the course, you will learn and practice new vocabulary. 
As you read articles, listen to recordings, watch videos, play games, and complete assignments.



In addition, each unit includes specific language and content goals.
We're going to do a quick preview of each unit now.
Don't worry if some of these words and concepts are new to you.
We'll explain everything more clearly in the rest of the course.
In unit 1, Is the Earth getting warmer? We look at the relationship between global warming and climate change.
Our language goals are previewing texts, and using comparative adjectives.
Our content goals are defining and understanding climate change.
In unit 2, the Greenhouse Effect, we will look at the chemistry behind climate change.
Our language goals are using the present progressive, and cause and effect.
Our content goals are focused on understanding how the greenhouse effect works.

In unit 3, the impacts of climate change on our world, we look at the effects of warmer temperatures on our environment.
Our language goals are reading for details, and using strong adjectives to describe things.
Our content goals are to identify the impacts and effects of climate change.
In unit 4, discovering cleaner energy sources to power the world, we will look at alternative energy sources. 
Our language goals are summarizing main ideas in a text, and using modals for suggestions.
Our content goals are learning about the science behind renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.
Finally, in unit 5, what might the future hold?
We look at both nanotechnology and the scientific community.
Our language goals are using modal verbs to discuss future probability, and how to cite sources in research. 
Our content goals are understanding the role of nanotechnology in reducing climate change, the role that the public can play in 
contributing to the scientific community.
Reading and listening assignments are required throughout the course, and each unit has two assessments designed to help 
you practice both language and content at the same time.
