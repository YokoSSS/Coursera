The Business Problem and Required Deliverables

The Business Problem and Required Deliverables
In this case study, you solve a real-world business problem by applying concepts that you learned in this course. 
Be aware that there are numerous solutions to this problem, and some can include concepts that are outside the scope of the course.

Business Problem
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security that has authority 
over the security of the traveling public. A claim is filed if you are injured or your property is lost or damaged during the screening process at an airport. 

Your first project is to prepare TSA Airport Claims and Enplanement data from 2013 through 2017 for analysis. You want  to determine 
how many claims occur at each airport every year, how many passengers fly at each airport every year, and the percentage of claims per airport.

The analysis program has already been completed, but it is your job to follow the requirements and prepare the tables correctly. 
After the tables are prepared, you can run the analysis program provided to answer the business questions.

Deliverables
There are three deliverables that need to be completed by the end of the case study. The final deliverable tables must be placed in the Sq library:

sq.Claims_Cleaned - a new table that is a clean and prepared version of the sq.claimsraw table

sq.ClaimsByAirport - a new table that is created by summarizing claims for each airport and year from the sq.Claims_Cleaned table and 
then joining the summarized data with the enplanement information (sq.enplanement2017 and sq.boarding2013_2016 tables)

FinalReport.html -the final HTML report produced by running the AnalysisProgram.sas on the prepared tables.

In the process of creating these three deliverables, you might need to create additional tables or views.
