sas program to access the practice data.

This table should include only FirstName, LastName, Employed, and MaritalStatus.

Perform an inner join on the Married column in the sq.customer table and MaritalCode column in the sq.maritalcode table.

Filter the Zip column for customers in the 10001 Zip code.

Run the query and view the results.

Run the PROC FREQ step to generate the crosstabulation of MaritalStatus and Employed.
