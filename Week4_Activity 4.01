Examine and run the first query. Confirm that the results contain one row and two columns.

Add the first query as a subquery in the second query to find all states with PopEstimate1 values higher than the average estimated state population.

Run the query.

正解
ERROR: A subquery cannot select more than one column.

ERROR: A Composite expression (usually a subquery) is used incorrectly in an expression.
This error occurs because we selected two columns in this subquery. The subquery can only return one column.  



proc sql;
select Name, PopEstimate1
	from sq.statepopulation
	where PopEstimate1 > (select avg(PopEstimate1), 
        "Average Estimated Population"
        from sq.statepopulation);
quit;
