Can you work out what this function does?
Try passing different parameters to the attempts function to see what it does. 

def attempts(n):
    x = 1
    while x <= n:
        print("Attempt " + str(x))
        x += 1
    print("Done")
    
attempts(5)


Attempt 1
Attempt 2
Attempt 3
Attempt 4
Attempt 5
Done



1	x = 0
2	while x < 5:
3	  print("Not there yet, x=" + str(x))
4	  x = x + 1
5	print("x=" + str(x))

How many times will "Not there yet" be printed?
5
正解
You got it! The variable x starts at 0 and gets incremented once per iteration, so there are 5 iterations for which x is smaller than 5.


問題
In this code, there's an initialization problem that's causing our function to behave incorrectly. Can you find the problem and fix it?

1	def count_down(start_number):
2	  while (start_number > 0):
3	    print(start_number)
4	    start_number = start_number - 1
5	  print("Zero!")
6	
7	count_down(3)


Here is your output:
3
2
1
Zero!

You nailed it! By initializing the current variable you got
the function to behave correctly.



問題
The following code causes an infinite loop. Can you figure out what’s missing and how to fix it?
次のコードは無限ループを引き起こします。何が足りないのか、どう直せばいいのか、わかりますか？

1def print_range(start, end):
2	# Loop through the numbers from start to end
3	n = start
4	while n <= end:
5		print(n)
		n = n + 1
6
7print_range(1, 5)  # Should print 1 2 3 4 5 (each number on its own line)
