If you feel comfortable with the topics in this course and want to treat this as a real-world problem, open and read the Self-Guided Version PDF and begin. 
This version gives you enough information to create the deliverable tables but leaves the approach to you. During the process, feel free to use your notes, 
Google, or SAS documentation.
