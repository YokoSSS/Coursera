1. What does IHL say about the use of new weapons technologies, such as armed drones? 


There is no specific provision in IHL that regulates the use of new weapons technologies. 


According to the principle of distinction armed drones are always prohibited. 


Article 36 API obliges State parties to conduct a legal review of new weapons. 


2.A drone strike by the government has hit the prominent military barrack from the Free Arfula Rebels (FAR) in the 
eastern Degaji district, and killed the well-known military commander Eqola. Some members of the Bogono family were
also hit by the strike. Does the governmentâ€™s drone attack violate the principle of proportionality?


Most likely the proportionality principle is not violated. The military target seems important to complete the military 
mission and the civilian damage seems not excessive. 


There is a lack of information to judge whether the proportionality principle is violated, because it is unclear 
how many civilians and civilian objects were hit by the military strike. 


Causing harm to civilians is always prohibited by IHL. 


3.Should the Free Arfula Rebels (FAR) have taken better precautionary measures to prevent the damage caused to the family?     


No. The FAR, being a rebel group, does not need to comply with IHL. IHL is only binding upon States. 


No. Only the attacking party must take precautionary measures. 


Yes. The attacked party must take feasible precautionary measures against the effects from attack. The FAR should not have
placed the military barracks close to the civilian population. 

4. Jan Bogono and his son have prepared their own Molotov Cocktails which they use shortly after a drone attack destroyed their house and
hit their family. Are Jan and his son lawful military targets? If so, from which moment and for how long?  


No. Jan and his son are civilians and therefore they can never be lawfully targeted. 


Yes. Jan and his son have prepared and used their own Molotov Cocktails. They have become lawful military targets 
for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities. 


Yes. Jan and his son have prepared and used their own Molotov Cocktails. This assimilates them to the armed forces. 
From this moment they are lawful military targets until the end of the war.
