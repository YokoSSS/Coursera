2.Remove the OBS=10 data set option and add the INOBS=10 PROC SQL option after the PROC SQL keywords and before the semicolon. 

Run the query. 

Are the results the same using the INOBS=10 option? 

1点

Yes: the results are the same because the INOBS= and OUTOBS= options do the same thing. 


Yes: the results are the same, but the INOBS= option only processes n number of rows, while the OUTOBS= option processes all rows but only returns the first n number of rows. 
Correct

No: the results are different.
