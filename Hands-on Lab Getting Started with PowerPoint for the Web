Hands-on Lab : Getting Started with PowerPoint for the Web
Estimated time needed: 20 minutes

Microsoft PowerPoint is the most widely used presentation software even three decades after its initial release. For all these years it has been available as a standard application that needed to be installed on your desktop; but it is not just a desktop app anymore. Now, you can even use PowerPoint when you're online by using 'PowerPoint for the web' - and run it right in your web browser without installing anything on your desktop!

'PowerPoint for the Web' (sometimes referred to as PowerPoint Online) can be used at no charge as part of a free Microsoft account. Although it does not have all of the capabilities of the desktop and paid online versions, the free web version provides many of the key features.

Software Used in this Lab
For the story telling/project report of this module, you will be using the free 'PowerPoint for the web' version as this is available to everyone.

Although you can use the PowerPoint Desktop software if you have access to this version, it is recommended that you use PowerPoint for the web for your project report as it is available for free, and there are some small differences in the interface and available features.
