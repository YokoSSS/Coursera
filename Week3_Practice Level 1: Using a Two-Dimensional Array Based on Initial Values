If necessary, start SAS Studio before you begin. If you restarted your SAS session, submit your libname.sas program to 
access the practice data.

The pg3.storm_stats table contains statistics such as MaxWindMPH for storms from seasons 1980 to 2016. 
For the storms in season 1980 and 1981, calculate the difference in a storm's MaxWindMPH compared to the 
quarterly maximum wind speed per season as shown below.


Open the p303p04.sas program in the practices folder. 

Run the program to view the MaxWindMPH for storms from seasons 1980 and 1981.

Add an ARRAY statement to create a temporary two-dimensional array named MWtable. 
The row dimension is based on two rows with a lower boundary of 1980 and an upper boundary of 1981.
The column dimension is based on four columns corresponding to the four quarters. The array elements 
should include the initial values as shown in the table above.

Add an assignment statement to create a column named MaxWindSQ. The value of this column will be retrieved 
from the MWtable array using Season for the row dimension and Qtr for the column dimension.

Add MaxWindSQ to the VAR statement in the PROC PRINT step. 

Run the program and view the results.

Add an assignment statement to create a column named Difference that is equal to MaxWindMPH minus MaxWindSQ.

Add Difference to the VAR statement in the PROC PRINT step. 

Run the program and view the results. 

What is the value of Difference for the 1980 storm named Lester (row 55)? Note: Type your answer as shown in the results.
