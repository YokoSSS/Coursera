1.If necessary, start SAS Studio before you begin. If you restarted your SAS session, submit your libname.sas program to 
access the practice data.

Open s104a02.sas from the activities folder and perform the following tasks to use a subquery in the HAVING clause:

Examine and run the first query. View the results.

Modify the second query. Copy the value returned by the first query into the subquery against the HAVING clause to 
return divisions with an average PopEstimate1 value greater than the total average of PopEstimate1.

Run the query you just modified. 

How many divisions have a higher average PopEstimate1 value than the average PopEstimate1 value of all the states? Note: Type a numeric value.

My Answer: 5
正解
5 divisions


proc sql;
select Division, avg(PopEstimate1) as avgDivisionPop
    from sq.statepopulation
    group by Division
    having avgDivisionPop > 6278420;
quit;


2.Remove the static value and add a subquery in the HAVING clause.

Run the query.

Did you get the same result this time you ran the query?

Yes
correct

The subquery should give the same result as the static value.


No


proc sql;
select Division, avg(PopEstimate1) as avgDivisionPop
    from sq.statepopulation
    group by Division
    having avgDivisionPop > (select avg(PopEstimate1)
        from sq.statepopulation);
quit;
