Level 1 Practice: Eliminating Duplicates

1.If necessary, start SAS Studio before you begin. If you restarted your SAS session, submit your libname.sas program to access the practice data.

The sq.globalfull table contains estimated financial information by geographic region and country for the population age 15 years and older. 
Using the sq.globalfull table, write a query to generate a report that displays the unique CountryCode values. 

Use the following requirements as you generate the report:  

Order the rows by the CountryCode.

Add the title Unique Country Codes.

Run the program and view the results.

Do you see any duplicate country codes?

/*s102s05.sas*/

title 'Unique Country Codes';
proc sql;
select distinct CountryCode
    from sq.globalfull
    order by CountryCode;
quit;

2.Modify the query to produce a count of the unique CountryCode values.

Name the result of the count CountryCount.

Add the title Count of Unique Country Codes.

Run the program and view the results.

How many unique country codes are in the sq.globalfull table?  

title 'Count of Unique Country Codes';
proc sql;
select count(distinct CountryCode) as CountryCount
    from sq.globalfull;
quit;
