1.If necessary, start SAS Studio before you begin. If you restarted your SAS session, submit your libname.sas program to access the practice data.

Use the sq.customer table to determine which Texas customers have higher than average credit scores.  

Using the sq.customer table, write a query to define the high-credit threshold as 2 standard deviations greater than the mean of CreditScore for TX customers.  

Use the following expression to create the column HighScore. This will be your future subquery result:   sum(avg(CreditScore),(2*std(CreditScore)))                

Run the query and view the results.

Write a second query to create a report showing Texas customers whose CreditScore value is greater than the results from the previous query. Use the query you just wrote as a subquery. Use the following requirements:  

Select CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, and CreditScore.

Subset the table for customers who are from the state of Texas and who have a greater CreditScore value than the value from the query in step 1.

Order the results by descending CreditScore.

Add an appropriate title.

Run the query and view the results.

In your report, what is the greatest value for CreditScore?  Note: Type a numeric value.
