Level 1 Practice: Defining and Using a Macro with Parameters


1.Reminder: If you restarted your SAS session, you must submit the libname.sas program in the EMC1V2 folder to access your practice files. 

Open m104p01.sas from the practices folder. Review and submit the program. Verify that it generates a report for Gold customers that contains 680 rows.

Convert the code to a macro named Customers that accepts a positional parameter named Type.  

Submit the macro definition and review the log to verify that the macro compiled successfully.

Call the Customers macro with the parameter value Gold. Verify that the title is Gold Customers and that there are 680 rows in the report.

Call %Customers again with the parameter value High Activity. Verify that no rows were selected due to a case difference.

Modify the macro definition:

Convert the value of the parameter Type to uppercase.

Modify the WHERE clause to make the string comparison case insensitive.

Submit the macro definition and verify that it compiled correctly.

Call the macro with the parameter value High Activity. Verify that the title is HIGH ACTIVITY Customers and that the report contains 461 rows.

Change the positional parameter to a keyword parameter with a default value of inactive.  

Call %Customers with the value high activity for the keyword parameter. Verify that the title is HIGH ACTIVITY Customers and that the report contains 461 rows.

Call %Customers without passing a parameter value. Verify that title is INACTIVE Customers.

How many rows are in the final report?

Note: Type a numeric value for your answer.
